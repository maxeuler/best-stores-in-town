# Best Stores In Town 🥘

## Stack 📚
+ Prisma
+ GraphQL
+ Apollo
+ React
+ NextJS

⚠️ With prisma and apollo ther's a whole lot of boilerplate stuff when starting a project. And there are also some vulnerabilities in the dependencies which aren't fixable right now. That's the reason I didn't expand this with many features to close this project as soon as possible and rather look for another GraphQL stack 🤷🏼‍
